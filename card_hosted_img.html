			<p id="summary">With a body length of 21-23 cm, the northern cardinal is a mid-sized songbird with a distinctive crest on the head and a mask on the face. There are 19 subspecies which can be found from southern Canada all the way down through Mexico. A few cardinals lack the enzyme to convert ingested yellow pigments properly, making their beak and feathers yellow, but their face mask remains black.</p>
